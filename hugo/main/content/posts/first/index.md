# First Post

Welcome to my brand new site fully built with [code](https://bitbucket.org/qgriffith/about_me/src/master/) I started this site to play around with dynamically building a site with [terraform](https://terraform.io) that builds out a Cloudfront frontend with an S3 backend. I use a bit of Python code to auto generate the fitness page to pull data from the Peloton API and soon to be Strava API. I added my resume so that I have it in one place and it will be auto updated on every merge to master using a deployment pipeline.
